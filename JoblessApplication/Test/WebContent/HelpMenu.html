					<header> I. Installation and System Requirements </header>
					<br>
					<h5>JoblessDB is a J2EE Web application for job advertisements
						/ job search.</h5>
					<br>
					<p>Software requirements:</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Server: GlassFish 4.0 <br>Database: MySQL <br>The
						application requires the set up of connection pool and JDBC
						resource.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Libraries: <br>JRE System Library [java-8-oracle] <br>JSF
						2.2 (Mojarra 2.2.0) <br>MySQL JDBC Driver <br>Web App
						Libraries <br>guava-18.0
					</p>
					<h4>II. Roles and levels of access:</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						Online registration is available only for User and Company roles
						with different profile <br>specifications required for the
						two types of users. <br> Administrators' / accountants'
						profiles are available by default in the <br>initial
						database. Owner information (necessary for the preparation of the
						invoices) <br>is once added in the database and can be
						accessed by <br>accountant(s) / administrator(s).
					</p>
					<h4>- Guest:</h4>
					<p>
						The guest user can view all job advertisements order by priority,
						<br>search for advertisements (possible search keys: key word
						in the title, location, category, company name, VIP status), <br>view
						advertisement, answer / send inquiry to the company. <br>S/he
						can also apply for standard advertisements via fulfilling /
						submitting personal CV, writing / <br>submitting Cover
						letter.
					</p>
					<h4>- User:</h4>
					<p>
						The user account inherits the basic functionality of the guest
						user. However, this is a registered user and can also <br>apply
						for VIP advertisements by filling the tests, included in the VIP
						advertisement. User registration requires <br>first and last
						name, valid e-mail, user name and password necessary for further
						login. <br>Validation of the e-mail and check of user name
						availability is added as well as validation (not null and more
						than 5 symbols) <br>and confirmation of the password. If
						invalid data (e-mail, user name or password) are provided, <br>the
						registration form is rendered with corresponding messages output.
						<br>After successful registration the user is invited to
						login in order to access the corresponding functionality.
					</p>
					<h4>- Company:</h4>
					<p>
						The company account is oriented towards job providers. It allows a
						registered company to submit a standard or VIP job advertisement.
						<br>In order to access this functionality, the user has to be
						registered. Information required for successful registration is: <br>company
						name, type (), address, valid e-mail, EIK (Единен идентификационен
						код; БУЛСТАТ), MOL (Материално отговорно лице), <br>as well
						as user name and password necessary for login on the web-site.
						Similarly to the User registration form validation of user name, <br>e-mail
						and password is added. After successful registration the
						company-user is invited to login in order to access <br>the
						corresponding functionality.
					</p>
					<h4>- Administrator (or admin):</h4>
					<p>
						The admin accounts are initially set up in the database and can
						not be registered online. The admin uses a user name and <br>password
						in order to access the admin panel. S/he can view new and old job
						advertisements, approve and publish new advertisements, <br>remove
						old ones, change priority of the advertisements, update / delete
						Users, approve / update Company users. <br>More information
						is provided in the admin panel.
					</p>
					<h4>- Accountant:</h4>
					<p>
						Similarly to the admin account, the accountant profiles are set in
						the database initially. <br>In order to access the
						corresponding functionality, the accountant has to authenticate
						her/himself with account user name and password. <br>The main
						functionality of the accountant user is the control over the
						payments connected with VIP advertisements and the <br>preparation
						of the necessary documents. More information is provided in the
						accountant panel.
					</p>
					<h4>- Owner:</h4>
					<p>
						Information about the Owner is kept in the Database and can be
						accessed by th accountant for the <br>preparation of the
						invoices for the paid VIP advertisements.

					<h3>Login and Registration Help Tab</h3>
					<h4>Find all the information needed to operate with login and
						registration module.</h4>
					<h4>MainPage</h4>
					<h4>JoblessDB application provides several options to its
						users as presented on the MainPage:</h4>
					<h4>- Login options:</h4>
					<p>
						Four login options are available with respect to the different
						roles. In order to access User, Company, Administrator or
						Accountant modules, <br>the user has to authenticate
						him/herself by providing username and password. While
						Administrators' and Accountants' credentials are <br>initialized
						and kept in the database, User and Company types of users have to
						register online by following the corresponding links, <br>provided
						on the MainPage (To register as user, click here. or To register
						as company, click here., respectively). <br>Entered username
						& password are compared with the information in the database and
						if provided information is correct, <br>the successful login
						redirects user to the required module.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						In order to be able to publish advertisements, Companies have to
						be approved by the Administrator who has the responsibility <br>to
						verify the information provided by the Company at the
						registration.
					</p>
					<p>- “Continue as Guest” allows the user only to view all job
						advertisements.</p>
					<h4>- Registration of User (To register as user, click here.)</h4>
					<p>
						In order to register the User has to provide First and Last name,
						valid e-mail, username and password. <br>Registration will be
						successful only if valid data are provided. Validation of the
						provided e-mail is performed during the typing process. <br>Availability
						of the username (i.e. whether the desired username is not already
						used by another user) is also checked during the <br>registration
						procedure. The validation of the password includes length (minimum
						5 symbols) and confirmation of the entered password. <br>White
						spaces are considered invalid input. Proper Error messages would
						appear if provided e-mail, username or <br>password do not
						match the validation criteria.
					</p>
					<h4>- Registration of Company (To register as company, click
						here.)</h4>
					<p>
						In order to register the Company has to provide Company name,
						type, address, e-mail, EIK (единен идентификационен код), <br>MOL(материално
						отговорно лице), username and password. Company type (ET, EAD,
						EOOD,...) can be chosen from a SelectOneMenu. <br>In case no
						type is chosen, the type of the company-user will be set in the
						database as "Undefined". <br>Similarly to the User
						registration, Company registration will be successful only if
						valid data are provided. <br>Validation of the provided
						e-mail is performed during the typing process. Availability of the
						username <br>(i.e. whether the desired username is not
						already used by another Company) is also checked during the
						registration procedure. <br>The validation of the password
						includes length (minimum 5 symbols) and confirmation of the
						entered password. <br>White spaces are considered invalid
						input. Proper Error messages would appear if provided e-mail,
						username or password <br>do not match the validation
						criteria.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						No validation of the EIK is considered as this information is
						supposed to be verified by the Administrator. <br>After
						successful registration the Company user is welcomed to login but
						(s)he will be able to publish advertisements only <br>after
						the Company profile is approved by the Administrator.
